# Lentil Pizza Crust
## Ingredients

+ 3/4 cup dry SPLIT red lentils uncooked
+ 3/4 cup water
+ 1.5 tsp garlic powder
+ 1/2 tsp dried basil
+ 1/2 tsp dried oregano
+ 3/4 tsp sea salt

## Instructions

1. Line a 12" round pizza tray with parchment paper and preheat your oven to 450 degrees F convection bake.
1. Add all the ingredients to a high speed blender and process on high for about 1 minute, or until completely pureed.
1. Pour the mixture on your prepared pizza tray and spread it out as thinly and evenly as possible, using a silicone spatula.
1. Bake for 12 minutes. Then carefully flip the dough, remove the parchment paper and return to the oven for 5 more minutes until the crust is nicely golden.
1. Top your pizza as desired and bake for a 3-5 minutes longer. Then remove from the oven and let rest for 1-2 minutes before slicing.

## Notes
+ Make sure it's evenly spread! For the best tasting, crispiest lentil pizza crust possible, do your best not to leave thicker spots in your crust. Be extra mindful of the center when spreading your crust to the edges. Thicker spots won't crisp up as well.
+ Don't spread TOO thin. Try not to fuss too much when spreading your dough and do so gently. Gently spread the batter across your tray without moving the parchment paper around too much or you may make create gaps in your dough. The wet parchment will crease easily, so don't use much force to spread the batter around.
+ Use convection bake. Convection bake uses a fan to blow the hot air around your oven. By circulating the air, you'll get a steady, dry temperature resulting in even cooking and a crispier crust. If you don't have a convection bake oven, you may need to cook your crust for a couple of extra minutes. Just keep an eye on it until desired crispiness is reached.
+ Use the bottom rack. Cook your lentil pizza crust on the bottom rack for best results. Again, this will help increase crispiness of your dough. Since individual ovens vary greatly, just make sure to keep an eye on your crust to prevent it from being overdone.
+ Parchment paper is your friend. Use the parchment paper to help flip the dough with ease after the first step of baking. Then gently remove the paper and discard to bake the other side.
