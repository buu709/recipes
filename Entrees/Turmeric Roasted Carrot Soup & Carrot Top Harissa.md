# Turmeric Roasted Carrot Soup & Carrot Top Harissa

MAKES 4 

## Ingredients

### Carrot top harissa:  
- 1 cup of green carrot tops, chopped  
- 1/2 cup of cilantro  
- 5 mint leaves  
- 1 small garlic clove, sliced  
- juice of 1/2 a lemon  
- 1/2 teaspoon of cumin  
- 1/4 teaspoon of salt  
- about 1/2 cup of extra virgin olive oil

### Turmeric spiced carrots:  
- 2 cloves of garlic  
- 1 teaspoon of turmeric  
- 1 teaspoon of cumin  
- 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon  
- 1/2 teaspoon of kosher salt  
- pinch of cayenne  
- 1/4 cup of olive oil
- about 10 carrots, trimmed  
- 1 large yellow onion, sliced into thick chunks  
- 5 cups of water (or a chicken or vegetable broth)
- juice from 1/2 a lemon

## Instructions

Make the spice rub, and roast the carrots:

-   Pre-heat the oven to 400º. 
-   Make the turmeric spice rub by placing all of the ingredient for the rub into a food processor and pulse until you have a consistent mixture. 
-   Place the onions and carrots onto a parchment lined baking sheet and rub them with the spice mixture. Roast for about 30 minutes, until the carrots are very soft/fork tender. 

While the carrots are roasting, make the carrot top harissa:

-   Place all of the ingredients for the carrot top harissa into a food processor (except for the oil). Pulse a few times, and then drizzle in the oil in a slow stream while the food processor is running, until you have a consistent mixture. Set aside until you're ready to serve. 

Blend the carrots, assemble and serve:

-   Place the roasted carrots and onions into a high-powered blender with the water (or broth) and the lemon juice. Blend on high until smooth. Taste and add any additional seasoning you feel necessary. If your broth was cold, or you do not have a blender such as a vitamix (which can heat the soup while blending), you might want to heat it up a little in a pot on the stovetop over medium-low heat. 
-   Distribute the soup amongst bowls, and drizzle with a spoonful of the harissa and any other additional topping you like.

## Notes
- If you're using water instead of chicken or vegetable broth, you will likely need additional salt, about 1/4-1/2 a teaspoon
- Additional/optional toppings: a drizzle of coconut cream or olive oil, a handful of toasted pumpkin or sunflower seeds
