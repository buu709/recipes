# Honey Mustard Rosemary Chicken and Potatoes

## Ingredients

### Meal

- 2-3 potatoes (depending on size of pan), cut into thin wedges or sliced
- 2 chicken breasts, cut into thick strips (or use tenderloins)
- 2 medium onions, finely diced             
- A small bunch of fresh rosemary            
- Olive oil           
- Salt & pepper

### Sauce

- 2 tbsp. Dijon mustard            
- 3 tbsp. grainy mustard            
- Juice of a large lemon             
- 1 tbsp. olive oil            
- 2-3 tbsp. honey            
- 2 cloves garlic, minced            
- Salt & pepper            

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 390F            
2. In an oven-safe skillet, cook the onions in a couple of  tablespoons of olive oil over medium-high heat on the stove until  softened and starting to brown, about 10 min.
3.  Take off the heat and arrange your potato slices on top in  an even layer. Drizzle with olive oil and sprinkle with salt &  pepper. Cover loosely with foil and bake in the oven for 15-20 minutes,  until softened.            
4. Meanwhile, mix all the sauce ingredients together in a bowl  or jar . Taste and adjust according to your preference; if you like more acidity add more lemon, more sweetness add more honey etc.            
5. Take the pan out of the oven and arrange your raw chicken on top of the potatoes in an even layer. Pour the prepared sauce on top,  making sure everything is coated. Throw a few sprigs of rosemary around  the chicken, cover again with foil and bake for 20 minutes.            
6. After 20 minutes, remove the foil and turn on your ovenâ€™s  broiler on high and bake for a further 15 minutes until nicely browned.  Serve immediately.
