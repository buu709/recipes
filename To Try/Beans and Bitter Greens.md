# Beans and Bitter Greens
## Ingredients
- 2 cups dried white lima beans, soaked overnight
- 3 cloves garlic, smashed 
- ⅔ cup olive oil, divided 
- 1 ½ cups diced ribs from mustard and chard greens, finely diced 
- 2 cups dry white wine 
- 3 bunches mustard greens, ribs removed and torn into medium pieces 
 - 1 bunch Swiss chard, ribs removed and torn into medium pieces 
- Fresh lemon juice
 
 ## Instructions
 1. Cook the beans in lightly salted water until softened, about 1 hour. Drain, reserving the cooking liquid. Smash one-fourth of the beans and set aside.

2. In a deep pot, combine the garlic with one-fourth cup oil over medium heat. Cook the garlic until fragrant and lightly toasted, 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in the finely diced ribs and cook a 2 to 3 minutes more to soften the ribs, careful not to burn the garlic. Stir in the white wine and bring to a simmer.

3. Stir in the greens and chard, along with the remaining olive oil, and cook until the greens are lightly wilted, about 5 minutes. Stir in the smashed beans, along with 1½ cups of the bean cooking liquid. Continue to cook until the mixture is thick and creamy. Adjust the consistency as desired with additional bean liquid, and season with 1 tablespoon salt and 2 teaspoons lemon juice, or to taste. This makes about 3 quarts.
