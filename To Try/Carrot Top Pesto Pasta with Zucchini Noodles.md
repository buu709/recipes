### Ingredients

Scale

#### Roasted Carrots

-   1 small bunch of carrots (should yield 1 1/2 cups sliced carrots)
-   1/2 TBS olive oil
-   pinch of salt

#### Carrot Top Pesto

-   carrot tops from the bunch of carrots, (leaves and tender stems only – you should get about 3/4 cup)
-   1/2 cup Earthbound Farm Half & Half Baby Spinach & Baby Arugula Mix
-   1 cup basil leaves
-   2 garlic cloves
-   1/3 cup shredded or grated parmesan
-   1/3 cup walnuts
-   1/4 cup olive oil
-   3 TBS water
-   1 TBS lemon juice
-   1 TBS miso paste
-   pinch of salt, if necessary

#### Pasta

-   6 oz. gluten-free angel hair pasta
-   3 medium zucchini
-   1 TBS olive oil
-   1 small yellow onion, diced

#### Optional Toppings

-   freshly grated parmesan
-   freshly ground pepper
-   lemon wedges

### Instructions

1.  Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with a silicone mat.
2.  Peel carrots and slice them thinly on the diagonal. In a bowl, toss sliced carrots with a 1/2 tablespoon of olive oil and a pinch of salt. Spread carrots on baking sheet and bake for 15 minutes, stirring after 10 minutes of baking. Remove from oven to cool.
3.  In a pot, bring a quart of water to boil and add a generous pinch of salt. Add pasta and cook for 7 to 8 minutes. Rinse under cold water and set aside.
4.  Rinse carrot tops thoroughly. In a food processor, blend all the carrot top pesto ingredients together. Taste to see if you need to add more salt.
5.  Trim ends of zucchini and cut into noodles using a vegetable spiralizer or a julienne peeler. Set aside.
6.  Heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a large sauté pan over medium heat. Add onions and cook until they soften, about 2 to 3 minutes. Add zucchini and cook for about 2 minutes. Turn off heat. Add pasta to pan and toss everything with 1/2 the pesto sauce. Feel free to add more sauce, if you like. Refrigerate remaining sauce for 1 to 2 days.
7.  Top pasta with roasted carrots, parmesan, pepper, and a bit of lemon juice.

### Notes

1. I like using 1 tablespoon of miso paste in my pesto, but you can replace that with 1/2 to 1 teaspoon of kosher salt.

2. Be sure to rinse the carrot tops thoroughly! I lot of dirt can get stuck in there!
