# Vegetarian Mexican Chorizo
## INGREDIENTS
-   5 dried ancho chiles ($0.25)
-   ½ tsp coriander seeds ($0.01)
-   1 tsp cayenne ($0.02)
-   ½ tbsp Mexican oregano ($0.05)
-   1 tsp cumin ($0.01)
-   3 whole cloves ($0.01)
-   3 tbsp tamari ($0.54)
-   4 tbsp apple cider vinegar ($0.20)
-   1 ¾ cup water ($0.01)
-   Salt & pepper to taste ($0.02)
-   3 tbsp refined coconut oil, divided ($0.42)
-   6 cloves garlic ($0.24)
-   3 cups TVP ($0.54)

## INSTRUCTIONS

-   De-stem and shake the seeds out of all the dried chiles. Add them to a pot, cover with water, and bring to a low boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for 10-15 minutes, or until the chiles are soft and pliable. Drain and add them to a blender.
-   In a dry skillet over low-medium heat, toast the whole coriander seeds until fragrant. Once toasted, add them to the blender along with cayenne, oregano, cumin, cloves, salt, pepper, soy sauce, apple cider vinegar, and water. Mix on high until smooth.
-   Pour the chile mixture through a mesh strainer into a bowl (make sure to work it through with a spoon or spatula). Set aside.
-   Heat 3 tbsp of coconut oil over low-medium in a small frying pan. Sauté the minced garlic for 1-2 minutes, then add in the dried TVP and stir to coat in the oil.
-   Add in half of the marinade and cook until most of the liquid is absorbed. Then, pour in the rest of the marinade and finish cooking until no liquid remains, about 10-15 minutes.
-   Serve your chorizo in recipes like papas con chorizo, quesadillas, soups, stews, sopes, empanadas, or tamales. Happy eating!

## NOTES

-   If you don’t want the chorizo overly spicy, half or omit the cayenne.
-   For more flavor, toast the dried chiles in a skillet for 3-5 minutes before boiling.
-   If you can't find Mexican oregano, the closest sub is marjoram.
