# Roasted Carrots and Couscous with Gremolata
## Ingredients
### Roasted Carrots
-   5 to 6 medium carrots
-   2 teaspoons olive oil
-   1/4 teaspoon salt
-   1/4 teaspoon black pepper
### Gremolata
-   1/4 cup carrot greens, stems removed
-   1/4 cup flat leaf parsley
-   1 clove garlic
-   1 teaspoon lemon zest
### Couscous
-   1 cup pearl couscous
-   1 teaspoon olive oil
-   1/4 cup almond slivers
-   lemon juice, for finishing

## Instructions

1.  Preheat oven to 400˚. Remove tops from carrots and slice in half lengthwise, then slice in half again. Chop each into 1/4″ thick pieces (leaving you with small, quarter pieces of carrots). You will want approximately 2 cups of diced carrots. Toss with olive oil, salt, and pepper and spread into a roasting pan. Roast carrots until tender but still have some crispness left, 20 to 25 minutes.
2.  While the carrots are roasting, bring a pot of water to a boil, add couscous, and cook for 8 minutes, remove from heat, and allow to sit until just past the al dente stage (tasting is your best friend). Drain, rinse, and toss with the one teaspoon of olive oil.
3.  To make the gremolata, roughly chop the carrot greens, parsley, and garlic. Add the zest and continue to chop until the mixture is well combined and the garlic/herbs are in fine pieces.
4.  Once carrots are done, combine with the couscous, gremolata, and almond slivers. Squeeze a bit of fresh lime juice on top and serve.

## Notes
If you’re unable to find carrots with the stems, use all parsley for the gremolata.
