**Ingredients:**

-   1 tbsp oil
-   1 white onion
-   2 tbsp curry powder (mild and spicy usually)
-   1 tsp each of turmeric, cinnamon, ginger (fairly optional)
-   1-2 tbsp chutney
-   Mixed veg (best combo is butternut, cauliflower, broccoli & zucchini)
-   2 cans of chickpeas
-   1 can of petit pois peas
-   1 can coconut milk/cream
-   1-2 cups of veg stock (add one cup at first and then add more if you need it)
-   1/2 cup quinoa (_optional_)
-   1 lemon

**Do each bit in order of the list:**

1.  Cook the onions in oil, once fragrant add the spices and a _tiny_ bit of water, and once the water has cooked away add the chutney and a bit more water. Stir this together and keep it cooking into a paste.
2.  Add the chopped veggies and chickpeas and stir them in the onion mix until mostly coated.
3.  Add coconut milk/cream and leave for a few minutes to simmer.
4.  Add the veg stock as you need it (until everything is covered by at least 1cm of liquid- the quinoa will soak up most of the liquid later, if you aren't adding quinoa then just one 250-350ml of vegetable stock is enough)
5.  Leave for 10-15 minutes for the veggies to cook. I like to lower the heat right down and let it simmer, stirring every now and then.
6.  If youâ€™re doing quinoa: Add the quinoa at the end and leave the curry simmering until the quinoa is cooked all the way.
7.  Then add _a lot_ of lemon juice and S&P as needed.
