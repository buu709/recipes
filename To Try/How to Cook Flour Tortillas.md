## INGREDIENTS
+ 3 cups (375g) all-purpose flour
+ 1 tsp salt
+ 1/4 cup (53g) neutral oil
+ 1 cup (217g) very warm water

## INSTRUCTIONS
###### Dough
1. Whisk the flour and salt together in a mixing bowl. In a separate bowl, mix the oil
and water together then add this to the bowl of flour and salt. Stir the dough
together with a spatula.
2. Note: the dough will seem crumbly at this point, but once you start the kneading
process, it will come together more uniformly.
3. Next, remove the dough from your mixing bowl onto a lightly floured surface.
Begin kneading the dough to form a ball that's sticky enough to stay together, but
not coming off on your hands. Keep folding over and pressing with your palm for
10 minutes.
4. If the dough appears too crumbly, continue adding a tbsp of water at a time until
you are able to form a texture similar to play dough. If it's too sticky, similarlyadd a tbsp of flour while continuing to knead.
###### Rolling
5. Cut the ball of dough into 12 smaller pieces. Roll each piece of dough in between
your palms until smooth and then flatten slightly. Once they are rolled and
flattened, cover with a towel to rest for at least 15 minutes up to a few hours (the
longer they rest, the softer they'll turn out).
###### Tortilla press
6. If you have a tortilla press, lightly flour the surface or use 2 pieces of a freezer
bag that fit in the press. Open the press and place a tortilla in the center, then
close it and press down to form tortillas about 6 inches in diameter.
###### Other techniques
7. If you don't have a tortilla press, use your hand to flatten the ball, then begin
rolling it out with a rolling pin on a lightly floured surface. The tortilla should be
quite thin (almost see-through.)
8. If you don't have a rolling pin, continue pressing down with a hard, flat surface
until your tortilla is the same size as the above methods.
###### To cook
9. Preheat a seasoned cast-iron skillet slowly (~8-10 minutes to heat it evenly) up to
medium. Then, add a tortilla in and cook on the first side for 30-60 seconds, or
until you see bubbles forming and light brown spots on the underside. Flip and
cook for another 30-40 seconds.
10. Note: for us, 30 seconds on the first side and 30 seconds on the second seems to
be the sweet spot with our cast-iron and gas stove, but you may have to adjust
depending on your stove and pan.
11. Remove from heat and wrap each tortilla in a tea towel to keep warm while you
cook the rest. Serve your flour tortillas warm with your favorite meals. Enjoy!
## NOTES
+ Some people use baking powder to create more Tex-Mex style tortillas. We don't
find it necessary, but you can add 1 tsp of baking powder to this recipe.
+ The resting period hydrates the flour and softens the gluten bonds, which makes
softer, more pliable tortillas.
+ Optional ingredients are not reflected in the price or calories of our recipes.
