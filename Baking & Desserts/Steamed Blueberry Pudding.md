# Steamed Blueberry Pudding

## Ingredients

- 2 eggs, seperated
- pinch of salt
- 1 tsp vanilla
- 1 tsp baking powder
- 1 cup sugar
- 1/2 cup margarine
- 1 1/2 cups flour
- 1/3 cup milk
- 1 1/2 cups blueberries

## Instructions

1. Beat egg whites with 1/4 cup sugar until stiff. Set aside.
2. Cream margarine with rest of sugar. Add vanilla salt, milk and egg yolks. Beat until fluffy
3. Add the dry ingredients.
4. Fold in egg whites
5. Gently fold in blueberries. Partridge berries or raisins may be substituted.
6. Pour into steamed pudding bag. Tie bag so there is a small amount of slack in the bag.
7. Add pudding to the pot containing the Jiggs Dinner and boil for 1 1/2-2 hours. If you add water add boiling water. Remove pudding from pot.
8. Allow to cool for 20 minutes before turning out.

## Notes

- Pudding is usually made in the same pot as Jiggs Dinner. Make sure your pot is large enough to hold all the ingredients for your dinner and your pudding. All ingredients should be covered in hot water. Rinse bag with cool water before filling with batter to prevent pudding from sticking to bag.
