# Instant Pot Greek Yogurt

## Ingredients

- 3785ml whole or 2% milk (low fat/fat free can be used but will be thinner)
- 2 Tbsp yogurt starter

### Tools
- Instant pot (glass or instant pot lid)
- Yogurt strainer or colander with cheese cloth
- Whisk
- Thermometer

## Instructions
1. Sterlize cooking pot - Run instant pot (lid locked and valve closed) through a steam cycle for 5 minutes with 3 cups of water. After cycle, dry and cool cooking pot.
2. Heat milk - Pour milk into chilled pot and cover with glass or instant pot lid (valve closed). Press 'yogurt' button and then 'adjust' button, until display says 'boil' (~45 minutes). Whisk milk every 15-20 minutes. When beep sounds, open lid, whisk and take temperature. Temp needs to be 180&deg;F (best results/thicker yogurt 183-185&deg;F)
* If temp is too low repeat boil cycle or use the saute/low function to increase temp, whisk continously.
4. Cool milk - When temp is reached, remove cooking pot, place in kitchen sink full of cold water and aerate milk using a whisk. Cool milk down to 95-110&deg;F, whisking often and before checking temp. (~10 minutes)
5. Temper yogurt starter - Remove about 1 cup of milk from the cooking pot, whisk in the yogurt starter then pour milk (with the starter) back into cooking pot, whisk thoroughly.
6. Incubate yogurt - Place cooking pot back into the instant pot and cover with lid. Press the 'yogurt' button and adjust the display to preferred incubation time (make sure 'normal' option is selected and check notes for incubation times; I prefer 7 hours).
7. Chill/firm yogurt - Cover the pot and place in the fridge for 6-8 hours.
8. Strain yogurt - Using a yogurt strainer or regular strainer with cheese cloth (place a bowl beneath strainer) strain yogurt, covered, for at least 2 hours in the fridge. (Should produce 8 cups of translucent/clear whey)
* If yogurt is too thin strain for longer, if too thick mix in some whey.

## Notes

- Yogurt starter = reserve from last batch or yogurt containing milk and live/active cultures ONLY
- Only use 2 Tbsp of starter to yield a much thicker and creamier batch
- Yogurt starter can be kept fro up to 3 weeks frozen
- Whisk milk bfore checking temps to avoid hot spots and inaccurate readings
- Pasteurized milk is no good to use as it does not contain enough bacteria.
- Incubation times:
- 8-10 hours = tart but not overly sour
- 6-8 hours = milder taste
- 10+ hours = more tart taste
- The longer the incubation time, the more beneficial bacteria in the yogurt is produced.
- If whey is cloudy add another layer of cheese cloth to straining device
- Whole milk makes thickest yogurt
- Whey = can also be used for yogurt starter (freeze the same way as yogurt). Can also be saved and used when baking bread or boiling potatoes
- If using frozen yogurt starter thaw before using
- Using cold water and not an ice bath to cool milk will yield better yogurt. An ice bath will shock the milk.
- Add sugar and sweeteners after yogurt has been chilled , can add vanilla extract or vanilla beans when adding the yogurt starter.
- Pro Tip: The bacteria in the yogurt needs to work without fighting with any sugar or sweeteners
- Yields: 2kg
- Active time: 1-2 hours
- Total time: 20-24 hours
- Pro Tip: Start yogurt process in the evening so it can incubate overnight, while you are sleeping
- Pro Tip: For yogurt that is lower in carbohydrates, incubate for 12-14 hours and then strain the yogurt for 4-12 hours. This will greatly reduce the sugar from the milk.
- The 'Normal' fuction is for incubating yogurt. The timer will start at 8:00 and can be adjusted up or down.
